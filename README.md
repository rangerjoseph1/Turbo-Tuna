# Turbo-Tuna
Author: Joseph Horton
A Flappy Bird clone built for the Android OS. 

Turbo Tuna will follow the basic one tap control functionallity that applications like Flappy Bird use. The player of this game will use this simple control to navigate thier Tunafish around obstacles. If the Tunafish hits one of these obstatcles, the game ends, the score is saved, and the user can play again.

In addition to the basic Flappy Bird style functionallity, This game may also include some powerups that allow the player to bypass various obsticles. 

I am creating this game to become familiar with GitHub and to become aquainted with Android development.
